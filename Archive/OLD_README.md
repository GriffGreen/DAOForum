# DAOForum
This Repo will initially serve as a space to collaboratively brainstorm, discuss, and vet ideas for a platform for intra-DAO communication. The goal being to eventually build the project into a real working forum for holders of various DAO tokens that specifically addresses their communication needs.

Please feel free to fork, raise issues, and submit pull requests. This is currently at the ground floor, so anyone who is interested in getting involved or wants to offer help of any kind feel free to reach out here or on Slack.

Real-time discussion is happening over at the slock.it slack on the #dao_forum channel. Sign up at http://slock.it:3000/
